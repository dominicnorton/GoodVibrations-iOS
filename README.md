# Good Vibrations

The Good Vibrations iOS framework allows for the playing of `.goodvibes` haptic pattern files to create delightful user experiences.

## Requirements
- Swift 5.5+
- iOS 14+

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager
```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/dominicnorton/GoodVibrations-iOS", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            ...
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "GoodVibrations", package: "GoodVibrations-iOS")
            ],
            ...
        )
    ]
)
```

## Usage
**In App Target**
- Include a `.goodvibes` file in your app target, ensuring they're included in **Build Phases -> Copy Bundle Resources**.
```swift
func playHaptic() async {
    try? await GVHaptics.play(from: .bundled(
        name: "my-pattern-bundled-in-app-target"
    ))
}
```

**In Module**
- Place any `.goodvibes` files in a resources directory.
- In your package manifest, ensure to declare this directory.
```swift
.target(
    name: "MyModule",
    resources: [
        .process("Resources")
    ]
)
```
- Once done, a `Bundle.module` should be generated by the compiler, allowing you to initiate a `.play` as below.

```swift
func playHaptic() async {
    try? await GVHaptics.play(from: .bundled(
        name: "my-pattern-bundled-in-module",
        bundle: .module
    ))
}
```

## Creating And Editing `.goodvibes` Files
To create and edit `.goodvibes` files, the Good Vibrations iOS App is recommended.
